[# Task-2
I used Superstore sales datqa form Europe Continent for this task. I preffered this dataset because this data had location data which allowed me to use the maps visualization on Power BI.

##Breakdown of the Visualization :

###Clear Slicer
This is to reset all the slicers we use while interacting with the report.

###Cards:
I used three cards which show the most important and prominant data from the sales data .i.e., Sum of sales, Sum of Cost and Sum of Profit. These data indicators are most prominant in the sales report and are at par with the design heirarchy.

###Pie Chart:
The pie chart showcases the quantity sold according to the regions of the continent of Europe.

###Central Customer Data Table:
Indicates the prominent customers of the Superstore and the data of cost, profit and sales induced by each of them.

###Bar Graph
Indicates the total number of sales made by each category of items sold on store.

###Line Graph
Demonstrates number of sales made each year quaterly.

###CheckBox Slicer:
Used to filter data of the report according to shipment mode of the products.
